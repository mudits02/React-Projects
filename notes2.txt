Started from Routes

1. useEffect Hook is called after every component render. Also the dependency array inside it is
   not compulsory to be declared there. Also if we use useEffect before the console.log("Header")
   , the output will be Header Name and then the callback of the useEffect. 


    dependency array conditions
        i. When the array is not declared -> The callback function is called everytime the component
           gets rendered.

        ii. When the array is declared but its empty -> Callback is called only once , in the initial
            render only and not after that.

        iii. When there is say a local state variable in the array, then the callback is called
             everytime the variable is updated.

2. Never use useState inside a if else condition or for loops, it throws error

3. Configuration in routing means that information that will define what will happen in a specific
   route.

4. RouterProvider will give the routing config to the page.

5. When we are using <Outlet /> , then the component of the children route will be rendered, in after
   a way we are dynamically routing and this is done to keep the header fixed and not change.

6. Outlet component gets replaced whenever we go that speific route.

7. We dont use anchor tag in react to navigate to pages, this is because when we use the anchor tag
   it reloads the entire page and that is something we dont want to as it reduces the speed.

8. We use <Link> </Link> to redirect to the another page instead because it does not reload the onChange
