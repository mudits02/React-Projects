1. Chunking / Code Splitting / Lazy Loading -> they are the same thing..

2. The reason for which why we do this is because there is a bundled js file of all the components
   in the JS tab of the developers tools which actually holds all the bundled code of the React we
   have written. So, we are breaking down down it into smaller peices coz if that file is too large
   , it will take time to load on the website because of many API calls on the same file

3. This might be not observable in small scale projects , but when we take to large scales
   it takes a lot of time to load.

4. Lazy loading means waiting to render content on a webpage until the user or the browser needs
   it. Lazy loading can help speed up webpage load times.

5. If we directly implement lazy-loading in react , it will give an error of component suspended
   This is because it takes a very short time period to load that Component or group of 
   component to load and it doesnt , so we use <Suspense></Suspense> and wrap our component that
   is to be lazy loaded around it where we are creating routes for our project.
